# MedChat
Your Healthcare companion

## Problem Statement:

Since the discovery of the Coronavirus (nCOV-19), it has become a global pandemic. The world went into an unprecedented state of fear owing to an unknown illness and it ended up putting spotlight on our health care sector. It has been a great challenge for the hospitals and healthcare staff to manage the flow of the high number of cases. Especially in remote areas, it is becoming more difficult to consult a medical specialist when the immediate hit of the epidemic has occurred. 
Everyone feared stepping out of their homes during the pandemic and hence, online health platforms helped them identify their health issues sitting at their homes. 

## Objectives:

•	A developing number of hospitals, nursing homes, and even private centres, presently utilize online Chatbots for human services on their sites. However, no one has ever made an individual application where a chatbot will do all the tasks for an user. Hence, we want to create a chatbot application where the chatbot communicates with the user and tries to solve his/her problem.
•	Many people in India have a fear of visiting hospitals and hence, this application can be a great tool for those who wish to identify their problem or a disease at an early stage.
•	To create a doctor database, irrespective of the hospital they work for, so that the user can approach any general physician for their problem.
